# Project Overview: GroomerGo

## 1. Introduction

GroomerGo is a mobile-first application designed for independent mobile dog groomers. The core concept is to streamline the daily workflow for the groomer by providing a map-based view of their appointments and to enhance the customer experience by allowing clients to track the groomer's arrival in real-time. The app will feature a distinct dark purple and yellow theme as requested.

## 2. Core Features

-   **Groomer Dashboard:** A central screen for the groomer showing a list of daily appointments and their locations plotted on a map.
-   **Appointment Management:** The ability for the groomer to view appointment details and update their status (e.g., "En Route", "Arrived", "Completed").
-   **Live Location Sharing:** When a groomer starts traveling to an appointment, their location is shared with the corresponding client.
-   **Client Tracking View:** A simple, web-based view for the client that shows the groomer's vehicle moving on a map, their current status, and an estimated time of arrival (ETA).

## 3. Target Audience

-   **Primary User (Groomer):** Independent, mobile pet groomers who manage their own schedules and travel to clients' homes.
-   **Secondary User (Client):** Pet owners who have booked a mobile grooming service and want to know when to expect the groomer.
