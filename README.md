# GroomerGo - Mobile Dog Grooming App

This project contains the complete design and prototype package for GroomerGo, a mobile dog grooming application that allows groomers to manage their appointments via a map and lets clients track the groomer's location.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following directories:

-   `/index.html`: The main project hub, linking to all other sections.
-   `/docs`: Contains all project documentation in Markdown format.
    -   `overview.md`: High-level summary of the project.
    -   `requirements.md`: Functional and non-functional requirements.
    -   `flows.md`: Key user flow descriptions.
-   `/wireframes`: Low-fidelity, structural HTML wireframes.
    -   `index.html`: An index of all wireframes.
    -   `*.html`: Individual wireframe pages for different app screens.
-   `/prototype`: A high-fidelity, interactive prototype built with static HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
    -   `index.html`: The main entry point for the prototype.
    -   `/assets`: Contains CSS, JavaScript, and mock data.

## How to Use

1.  **Start at the Hub**: Open the root `index.html` file in your web browser.
2.  **Explore**: Use the navigation cards to jump between the documentation, wireframes, and the interactive prototype.
3.  **Review Documentation**: Read the files in the `docs` directory to understand the project's goals and specifications.
4.  **Analyze Wireframes**: View the files in the `wireframes` directory to see the basic layout and user flow structure.
5.  **Interact with the Prototype**: Open `prototype/index.html` to experience a clickable, data-driven simulation of the application. The prototype uses mock data and does not require a backend.
